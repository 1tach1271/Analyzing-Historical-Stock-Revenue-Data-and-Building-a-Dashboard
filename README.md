**Stock & Revenue Dashboard Analysis**

This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

In this project, I extracted historical stock price data and quarterly revenue data for Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop using Python. The data was collected using yfinance and web scraping (BeautifulSoup), cleaned using Pandas, and visualized using Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

The dashboard helps analyze trends, revenue growth, and stock performance over time.

**Tools Used**

Python | Pandas | yFinance | BeautifulSoup | Plotly | Jupyter Notebook
